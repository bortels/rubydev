rubydev
=======

Ruby 2.1.5 plus my commonly used gems and utilities (git, jq, and so on)

Not much to it really. Look at the Gemspec file for the list.

Launch Script: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bortels/rubydev/master/rubydev

Note that the launch script shares /tmp in the
container as /tmp/rubydev to make it easy to move
files in/out if need be.

This will show up on the docker index at https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/bortels/rubydev/
