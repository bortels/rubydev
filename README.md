rubydev
=======

Ruby 2.1.3 plus my commonly used gems.

Not much to it really. Look at the Gemspec file for the list.

Launch Script: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bortels/rubydev/master/rubydev

Note that the launch script shares /tmp in the
container as /tmp/rubydev to make it easy to move
files in/out if need be.
